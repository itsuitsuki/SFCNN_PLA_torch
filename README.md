# SFCNN_PLA_torch

The implementation for Assessing the Reliability of AlphaFold3 Predictions for Protein-Ligand Affinity Prediction via [SFCNN](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-022-04762-3). Also the repository for CS177 SP25 Course Project, ShanghaiTech. The original code for SFCNN is published [here](https://github.com/bioinfocqupt/Sfcnn) written in TensorFlow, while we adapt this into a version written by PyTorch.
